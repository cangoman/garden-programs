This is an attempt at a (mostly?) DIY automated hydroponic garden. This repo will contain the code used for the sensors/actuators, and perhaps some more documentation on the progress of the project. 

The initial idea is to build a 2 level garden in a VivoSun tent: 
- Level 1 will be a deep water culture, possibly to grow a variety of lettuce and leafy greens, like spinach and kale
- Level 2 will be an NFT system, where I'm thinking of growing some strawberries and perhaps some other small fruits, like cherry tomatoes.

The plan is to monitor temperature, humidity and light intensity within the tent, as well as pH of the water in the reservoir, and eventually use that data to automate the garden.



I'll also try to document the resources I use as I go.
I'm using the book DIY Hydroponic Gardens by Tyler Baras to build the system.
